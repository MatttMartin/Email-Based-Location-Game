BEFORE USE:
change the variable "user" to an email of your own that you don't mind being filled with emails.

To use this game:
run rando.py, then from the email you put in current_email.txt, send just the word "help" to the email you set in the previous step.
This will give you instructions on how to use it.

Once you receive coordinates:
use a gps app such as google maps to go to the coordinates given and see what you find!
